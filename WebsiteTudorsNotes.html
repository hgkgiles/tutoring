The good government happened for only six years, 1534-1540, and the bad government from 1509-1529, and then again from 1540-1547. Cromwell was a fantastic administrator who revolutionised the English government, but he didn&#39;t last long. Wolsey was a weak administrator mainly interested in enriching himself. Before Cromwell and Wolsey England wasted money on needless wars, and after Cromwell was executed there was no real plan and &#39;factions&#39; within the government spent their entire time fighting each other. However, the contribution of Cromwell was so good that England had a stronger and more modern government by the end of Henry&#39;s reign (1547) than the end.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c27 c13">Was the King in control, or were his ministers in control?</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c27 c13"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c13 c27"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">Section Three: Foreign Policy Henry VIII</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">What you need to answer: </span></p><ul class="c1 lst-kix_bqmu5kmkufba-0"><li class="c0 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">How successful was Henry&#39;s Foreign policy?</span></li><li class="c0 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">Who was to blame for the failures and successes?</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c27 c13">How successful was Henry&#39;s foreign policy?</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13">GOOD THING ONE</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span class="c11">Henry started his reign off with a success against France 1512</span></p><ul class="c1 lst-kix_1vzzu484c2do-0 start"><li class="c0 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15 c13">What happened?</span></li></ul><ul class="c1 lst-kix_1vzzu484c2do-1 start"><li class="c0 c4 li-bullet-0"><span>The &#39;</span><span class="c17">League of Cambrai</span><span class="c2">&#39;
